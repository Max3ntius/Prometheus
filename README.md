Prometheus
==========

This is an Honors Thesis repository for someone studying at Washington State University.  
Feel free to clone this or fork it.

The Prometheus project is an interactive (nominally) site that allows people to learn more about the city of 
Prague, Czech Republic, through an academic lense while still maintaining standards compliance (this entire 
project is built using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery).  

It's an open source project, to be licensed under the GPL.
